As we all know, mental health problems in India are not recognized well.

The question to be answered is – What are mental health problems? How many types are
there? And how to deal with them?

Firstly, there are many different mental disorders, with different presentations. They are
generally characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions,
behaviour and relationships with others.

Mental disorders include depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses,
dementia, and developmental disorders including autism.

The problem that arrives in India is that first and foremost many people are unaware of the
mental health scenario. They don’t even consider mental health to be a thing and mental
health problems to be real problems. So, the first step needs to be that people should be
made aware about such things, which has been growing in recent years because of pandemic
and even more so after the Sushant Singh Rajput’s case. People have started acknowledging
these problems. Even after this many people still consider mental health problems a taboo
and are afraid or inconsiderate to talk about them.

Thinking upon the current scenario, the best solution that we could think of was to make
some type of tool that is accessible to masses so that one could easily ponder upon their
mental health state and get a reality check without facing the social stigma.

So, we set our aim as to create a platform that will be accessible to all, and one does not
have to face any criticism for expressing his/her feelings. They can just go to this platform,
fill in a couple of forms and get help from professionals.
